    "description": "We are always online, connected, yet more alone than ever. In a world saturated with noise and cultural complexity, the simple act of being understood feels increasingly out of reach. Strangely Familiar invites us to slow down and reflect on what it truly means to coexist across cultures in a chaotic world.\nDirected by Kuik Swee Boon, founding Artistic Director and main choreographer of Singapore’s leading T.H.E Dance Company, Strangely Familiar unites a crosscultural team from Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Macao in a bold attempt to dissolve the boundaries between cultures, identities and realities. By letting go of labels and assumptions, the work opens space for a shared humanity that feels strange but familiar.\nPowered by holographic projection and cutting-edge technology, this highly anticipated new creation features the virtual presence of Hong Kong dance artist Zelia ZZ Tan, challenging us to rethink connection, presence, existence across both physical and digital realms.\nT.H.E Dance Company is lauded for its distinctive choreographic voice. Its 2011 production As It Fades was hailed as a landmark in Asia’s contemporary dance scene. Now, in a new commission by Asia+ Festival and the Singapore International Festival of Arts, the company unveils the world première of Strangely Familiar in Hong Kong – a timely and thought-provoking encounter.",

    "description": "Canadian-Vietnamese pianist Dang Thai Son is the first Asian pianist to claim the top prize in International Chopin Piano Competition. Having performed in over 40 countries in iconic venues such as the Barbican Centre, Musikverein Wien, and Sydney Opera House, Dang has appeared as a soloist with leading orchestras including the BBC Philharmonic, Orchestre de Paris, St. Petersburg Philharmonic, Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal and NHK Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of conductors such as Sir Neville Marriner, Vladimir Ashkenazy, and Pinchas Zukerman. His legendary journey from practising piano in a bomb shelter during wartime Vietnam to performing in the most important concert halls worldwide is a testament to music’s enduring power.\nThis recital programme features Chopin’s Scherzo No.2, the work for which he won the first prize at the 10th International Chopin Piano Competition, launching his international career and remaining a hallmark of his recitals ever since. Dang will also perform Fauré’s Nocturne and Barcarolle, Ravel’s Miroirs, and a selection of Chopin’s nocturnes, waltzes and polonaises.",

    "description": "As the condolence letters of a surviving brother transform into music, his late brother responds through dance.\n\nAt the threshold of reunion, they say farewell, their souls healed.\n\nIvanhoe Chun-ho LAM, artist-in-residence at the East Kowloon Cultural Centre, continues to deepen his exploration of Simon Stephens' play Song From Far Away after the work-in-progress presentation\n\nSo Far, So.... Together with his creative team, they blend monologues, body movement, live choral singing, beatboxing, electronic music, real-time video, and multimedia installations, transforming multiple disciplines into one artistic journey that transcends life and death, offering the audience an experience that is both intimate and communal. Constructed over 365 days and building on the work in progress, a complete version of two interdependent performances (Song From Far Away and Far Away From Song) will be held in two venues, The Turns and The Lab. Both venues are simultaneously connected but distant, where time and space overlap and concur together. A single ticket enables the audience to pass between the realms of life and death.\n\nTwo venues, two forms of participation: one is a fluid, immersive environment—hotels, airports, trains—where one experiences letter writing through sound and music in headphones. Here, audience members are onlookers, passers-by…strangers. The other is a place for spiritual retreat: The body pauses to reach healing through meditation channels. Audience members become participants in an intimate ritual.\n\nSong From Far Away is a journey home: a return to an estranged family and forgotten relationships. The seven letters from the older brother to his deceased younger brother mourn the past while confronting his own failings. The physical body sways between light and shadow, in a kind of requiem, as the sounds of everyday objects transform into laments—a transmission of contemporary songs of spiritual connection. The multiplicity of senses creates a poetic field as the ignited letters turn into rising smoke.\n\nFar Away From Song becomes the echo of what is absent in the play: The soul sheds the weight of the body, moving in the bardo realm in response to the letters from the older brother. At the end of the journey, their farewell provides for a final reunion.\n\nThe cast will be announced in due course, please stay tuned.",

    "description": "In the 1970s, bass was often relegated to an accompaniment role. However, talented bassist Jaco Pastorius, with his exceptional playing technique, innovative chords, and tonal developments, transformed the instrument into a leading musical presence. Whether in his fusion jazz band Weather Report or in his personal musical journey, his playing was captivating. Although this prodigy passed away at the young age of 35, he remains etched in the hearts of music fans as one of the greatest bassists of all time.\n\nIn this concert, Japanese bass master Tetsuo Sakurai will pay tribute to this American legend by reinterpreting his classic pieces. Sakurai was a core member of the band Casiopea, infusing the group with vibrant bass performances, and later embarked on a solo career that has taken him to over twenty countries. Now, he will come to Hong Kong to honor the genius bassist Jaco Pastorius with his superb artistry.",
