    "description": "Over a century ago, when the Lumière Brothers first screened films for the public, alongside the renowned The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat, there was also Le Repas de bébé, capturing footage of Auguste Lumière feeding his daughter. In that forty seconds, it recorded not only food consumption, but also a precious moment of parent-child bonding. From this short film onwards, countless films centred on food have been produced, with various suggestions readily available online. The finest among them explore more than mere chewing and digestion. Food transcends from being a source of nutrition; it connects to emotions, culture, history, identity, and belonging. It has the power to bring people together and evoke our feelings and memories.\n\nIf one were to transform a food movie playlist into a cuisine menu, the light-hearted Kamome Diner would make an ideal starter. Serving up delectable bites, it draws strangers closer, fostering unexpected friendships in the homeland of the Moomins. The Lunchbox is another touching tale, where a misdelivered lunchbox sparks heartful exchange between two strangers. Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner tells a pre-meal story itself, tackling serious themes with light-hearted humour. Toast also serves as an appetiser, as the son traces the origins of his culinary passion through his childhood recollections.\n\nAs for main course, Babette’s Feast and Big Night could hardly be more fitting. Both depict individuals in foreign lands preparing lavish feasts originating from their homeland, treating culinary delights as divine blessings. Julie & Julia and Cooking History both use cookbooks as conduits to explore deeper themes. The former uses a cookbook to bridge two eras, invoking a dialogue between women across generation and time; the latter employs recipes to weave together six historical segments, tracing the stories of military cooks and soldiers to observe shifting tides through kitchen windows. First Cow also delves into history, tracing back to the American frontier era to depict two men’s culinary entrepreneurial dreams.\n\nFor dessert, comedies may offer some light-hearted delights. Tampopo indulges in dark humour, brimming with exaggerated satire that remains rich without being overpowering, sweet at an amount that is just right. The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover could also be viewed as a black comedy on the absurd side while masterfully blending cuisine with love and hatred. The Chinese Feast not only fulfils the requirements of a festive comedy but also combines culinary themes with kung fu and wuxia elements. Though not a comedy, Boiling Point features a seamless single-take rhythm, making it a delightful after-dinner treat that lingers in the memory.\n\nToday’s special selection features Master Cheng, starring Chu Pak-hong. Like Kamome Diner, it was also filmed in Finland, setting against the soothing landscapes of Scandinavia. It will be screened at the East Kowloon Cultural Centre (EKCC). Concurrently, the enrichment programme “Bon Cinéppétit!” invites audiences to share memorable flavours remind them of these fourteen films, which will be compiled into a display at the EKCC and online. Participating viewers could earn free tickets to a delectable “Grand Finale”, a multi-sensory screening of Ratatouille and An. The former, a family-friendly animation, conveys the universal aspiration that anyone can cook; the latter, through the story of a dorayaki shop, captures insights into life, mutual understanding, and care between people.\n\nSpecial thanks to the four art directors for taking time to attend the seminars, and heartfelt gratitude to all guest speakers for agreeing to participate in the post-screening talks. We hope this diverse menu of film genres and styles invites audiences to join us for a feast for the eyes, ears and taste buds. Let’s embark on a soul-stirring journey of flavours.\n\nCurator｜Ernest Chan",

The elder brother, also the perfectionist chef, refuses to compromise his standards to pander to customers’ tastes. The younger one is the manager, who aspires to make his mark in the culinary world, dreaming for Italian cuisine to win acclaim. Yet realising their dream proved difficult; customers’ response is lukewarm, tensions begin to surface between the brothers, and their frustration deepens witnessing competitors draw crowds without prioritising food quality. To save the restaurant, they stage a lavish VIP banquet, determined to turn their fortunes around. Directed by Campbell Scott and Stanley Tucci, with the latter also starring as the younger brother, this low-budget production became a food film classic. Risotto tricolore, timpano, and Fiorentina sauce – the dishes left diners spellbound. Even a simple fried egg carries the weight of unspoken emotions.",

Before the doors have even opened, the kitchen is already in chaos. To make things worse, a health inspector arrives for an inspection, deeming the kitchen hygiene substandard. Even the seasoned head chef felt under immense pressure, his nerves taut, seemingly weighed down by deep concerns. As guests stream in, one is planning a marriage proposal, some are deliberately causing trouble, and a celebrity chef unexpectedly hosts a surprise visit of a food critic. Chaos is looming and everything is on the line. A signature work from the creative team behind Adolescence, this film draws on the personal experiences of chef-turned-director Philip Barantini. Originally conceived as a short film of the same name, it was expanded into a 90-minute single-take film.

In the early 19th century American West, people ventured into the wilderness of mountains and forests, dreaming of sudden riches. A gentle, meticulous chef meets a sharp, resourceful Chinese labourer, and the two bond instantly, sharing hardships and forging a partnership. Exceling at baking pastries, the chef begins selling fresh oily cakes with the help of the Chinese, who possesses a keen business sense. However, their recipe requires milk, compelling them to steal it from the landowner’s milking cow under cover of night. This clandestine ingredient made their cakes legendary, drawing even the dairy owner’s attention. Would their secret be exposed? The acclaimed American independent filmmaker Kelly Reichardt revisits the desire-driven origins of the capitalist American dream through mouthwatering pastries, depicting a tender male friendship that subverts the rugged masculinity of traditional Westerns with understated warmth.",

One day she encounters a truck driver in cowboy attire who stood up for her. Discovering his profound knowledge of flavour, Tampopo decides to apprentice under him, undergoing hellish training to master mouth-watering culinary skills. Much like a ramen-themed version of Shane, Itami Juzo focuses not merely on the mission to save the eatery, he employs a kaleidoscopic plot structure that transcends cinematic genres.

His culinary talent became apparent in his teens, despite his mother being a poor cook who disdained fresh ingredients, but favouring tinned vegetables instead. When meals went wrong, she would simply serve toasts for supper. In spite of this, maternal love proved irreplaceable and ignited Nigel’s desire to cook for himself. After his mother’s passing, the arrival of the exquisitely skilled and alluring Mrs Potter spurred him to compete with her for his father’s affection and appetite. Adapted from Slater’s memoir, director Clarkson transforms these intimate childhood recollections into a drama.

    "description": "Hong Kong filmmakers and film workers of its golden age formed deep bonds with each other. Kindred spirits often became sworn brothers and sisters as an expression of their friendship and appreciation for each other. Such legendary alliances include ‘The Seven Idles’, a group of elite behind-the-scenes crew in the 1950s; the ‘Eight Peonies’, consisting of celebrated opera performers in the 1960s; and the opera starlets known for playing second female leads erbang huadans, who became the ‘Nine Big Sisters’. In 1965, seven young actresses—who all started out as child actors and were brought together by their shared journey in film—formed a sisterhood known as the famous ‘Seven Princesses’.\n\nThe Seven Princesses, in order of seniority, were Fung So-bor, Shum Chi-wah, Connie Chan Po-chu, Josephine Siao Fong-fong, Nancy Sit Kar-yin, Wong Oi-ming, and Fung’s younger sibling, Fung Bo-bo. Each a star in her own right, these seven actresses often collaborated onscreen, and have shared an intimate, enduring sisterly bond offscreen for six decades.\n\nIn commemoration of their 60th anniversary, the Hong Kong Film Archive presents a special programme, ‘Youthful Imprints’, spotlighting the early works of the Seven Princesses, including those made before and after their bond. Fifteen films will be screened across four categories: ‘Commemoration of Sisterhood’, ‘Signature Works’, ‘Youthful Love’, and ‘Shadows of Grace and Intrigue’.\n\nThough the seven actresses have appeared in many films in various pairings from a young age, only one film featured all of them together: Seven Princesses. This film, along with its sequel will be screened as part of ‘Commemoration of Sisterhood’. ‘Signature Works’ features one representative film per princess, showcasing defining moments of breakthrough in their careers, such as Connie Chan’s first lead role in a contemporary drama You Do Me Wrong (1966) and Nancy Sit’s debut as leading lady in Bunny Girl (1967). In the late 1960s, as the princesses grew up into young women, they stepped into roles that captured youthful dreams and romantic longing, as befitting their maidenly images. The four films in ‘Youthful Love’ alternate between charming and bittersweet tales of love, highlighting this period in the princesses’ careers. Finally, ‘Shadows of Grace and Intrigue’ captures the princesses’ martial prowess. Connie Chan, Josephine Siao and Shum Chi-wah trained under Peking opera master Fen Ju Hua, and their Northern-style martial arts skills are on full display in the selected action films, where they deliver unforgettable performances as heroines in costumes.\n\nThe Archive has digitally scanned some selected films, which will be screened for the first time as part of this programme, offering cinephiles enhanced audio-visual quality. Select screenings will also feature post-screening talks with members of the Seven Princesses and film critics.",
